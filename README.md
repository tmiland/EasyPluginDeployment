EasyPluginDeployment
====================

upload plugin files to multiple ftp hosts

Okay, this bash script is for Fragnet servers: (change the red txt according to your prefs) 

- Create the file procon.sh in the folder procon

- Then add sub folders Plugins/BF4

- Now you have /home/username/procon/Plugins/BF4 and to upload your plugin, place it in the BF4 folder under /home/username/procon/Plugins/
This will also work with .inc files, just keep the folder structure to upload as is. ;)

- Now CD to the /home/username/procon folder and run the command sh procon.sh to upload your plugin(s) to all defined FTP servers. :)
