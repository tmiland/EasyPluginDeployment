====================

upload plugin files to multiple ftp hosts

Okay, this bash script is for Fragnet servers: ([COLOR="#FF0000"]change the red txt according to your prefs[/COLOR]) 

- Create the file [CODE]procon.sh[/CODE] in the folder [CODE]procon[/CODE]

- Then add sub folders [CODE]Plugins/BF4[/CODE]

- Now you have [CODE]/home/username/procon/Plugins/BF4[/CODE] and to upload your plugin, place it in the BF4 folder under [CODE]/home/username/procon/Plugins/[/CODE]
This will also work with .inc files, just keep the folder structure to upload as is. ;)

- Now CD to the [CODE]/home/username/procon[/CODE] folder and run the command [CODE]sh procon.sh[/CODE] to upload your plugin(s) to all defined FTP servers. :)
